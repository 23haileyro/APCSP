    <p class="p">In my art class this year, we were assigned to alter a book <br>(cutting pages, painting over pages, and creating something new).<br> I decided to create a pirate ship using paper mache, use a glue formula <br>to make the pages (waves) stick upwards and acrylic paint. Through <br>this process, I learned how to manipulate different mediums to create <br> what I want and also try something new. </p>

    <p class="p"> For my AP Environmental Science class, I researched and did <br>a case study on dead zones and their affects on Gulf of Mexico <br>(as well as the surrounding communities that rely on the Gulf for <br>the economy). By completing this project, I learned more about the way <br>the world works and the importance of the Gulf. Also, I learned more <br>about the species in the Gulf, the ways people rely on the Gulf, and the way the Gulf changes negatively.</p>
