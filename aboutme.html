    <p class="p">My name is Hailey Ronen and I am a junior at Piedmont High School. <br><br>
    I grew up in Piedmont, CA though I was born in Walnut Creek. I have 2 dogs and a cat. I love to hike with my dogs at Tilden,<br> a hike my mom and I have enjoyed for a long time.I love to read, draw, and play sports. I have played sports my whole life: from soccer, to basketball, to now softball.<br> I also love to bake. I used to bake many different things with my sister for different celebrations, for example, a cake for our dad's birthday. <br>My favorite foods all involve hummus because my dad and his family are from Israel and make the best hummus. I have played <br> piano for 3 years and have loved to play in my free time.</p>
